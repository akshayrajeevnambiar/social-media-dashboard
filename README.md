# Frontend Project: Social Media Dashboard with Theme Switcher

Welcome to my frontend project repository for the Social Media Dashboard with a theme switcher. This project was created as a response to a challenge presented by Frontend Mentor, aimed at enhancing frontend development skills.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a responsive social media dashboard where users can toggle between light and dark themes. It incorporates HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and a bit of JavaScript for interactivity.

### Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: All interactive elements on the page have hover states, enhancing user engagement.
- **Theme Switcher**: Users have the ability to toggle between light and dark themes, providing flexibility and personalization.

## Project Structure

### Design Assets

The design assets provided by Frontend Mentor are located in the `/design` folder. Both mobile and desktop versions of the design are included in static JPG format.

### Assets

All required assets, such as images, are stored in the `/images` folder, already optimized for performance.

### Style Guide

For consistency, the project includes a `style-guide.md` file containing essential information like color palette and fonts.

## Development Process

### Workflow

I followed a flexible workflow for building this project. Here's a suggested process:

1. **Initialization**: Initialized the project as a public repository on GitHub for easy collaboration and sharing.
2. **Planning**: Analyzed the provided designs to plan out the project structure and styling approach.
3. **HTML Structure**: Started by structuring the content with HTML, ensuring a well-organized layout.
4. **Base Styles**: Implemented base styles including fonts and general content styles.
5. **Styling**: Styled each section of the dashboard progressively, focusing on responsiveness and consistency.
